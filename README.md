## Dutch National Flag Problem
The Dutch National Flag Problem is a sorting algorithm for an array containing just 0s, 1s, and 2s.  Imagine the array as colored balls like the Dutch flag (red, white, blue). You need to arrange the balls (numbers) such that 0s (red) are grouped at the beginning, 1s (white) are in the middle, and 2s (blue) are at the end. The challenge is to do this in one pass through the array and using only constant extra space.
